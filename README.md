# Sorting Visualizer

This Sorting Visualizer is a web application that allows you to visualize the process of different sorting algorithms. It provides a visual representation of how sorting algorithms work by animating the sorting process on an array of elements.

## Algorithms Included

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Heap Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap sort
- Merge sort

## Features

- Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms
- Adjustable array size
- Adjustable sorting speed
- Randomize array functionality
- Sort for visualization

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Getting Started

To run the Sorting Visualizer locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prathu21-star/sorting-visualizer.git
   Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

Explore the sorting algorithms by adjusting the settings and starting the visualization.

## Usage

Adjust the array size using the provided slider.

Control the sorting speed with the speed slider.

Click the "Randomize Array" button to generate a new random array.

Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.

Click the "Sort" button to begin the visualization.

Feel free to experiment with different array sizes, sorting speeds, and algorithms to gain a better understanding of how sorting algorithms work.
